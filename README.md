## ☕ Support

This is a free tool built for the community — no expectations, no obligations. I genuinely enjoy building it.

That said, if you'd like to see bigger improvements or help make a Mac App Store release possible (which comes with real costs for signing and distribution), a small donation goes a long way — you can find the BuyMeACoffee link in the Sponsor section of this repo.

Either way, thanks for using it!

### Installation

**macOS:**  
The app is unsigned, so on first launch you'll need to right-click the app and select "Open" (or use System Settings → Privacy & Security → "Open Anyway").

**Windows:**  
Run the EXE directly. If Windows Defender warns you, click "More info" → "Run anyway".
